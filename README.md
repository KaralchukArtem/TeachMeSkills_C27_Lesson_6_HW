Homework for sixth period.

Task1 - 
  We created the “Credit Card” class with the fields “Bank Account Number” and “Current Account”.
  I created one constructor with two parameters.
  We have created the “Client Transaction Card” service in which we implement methods for increasing and decreasing the amount,
  outputting information to the console in the new “Client” class

Task2 - 
  We created a class to describe the students of our group (Student).
  I created one constructor with five parameters.
  Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name, age.
  We created objects of this class in a new class “Program” for each student in our group.
  We put all these objects into an array.
  We iterated through the array with a for-each loop and printed the information to the console.
